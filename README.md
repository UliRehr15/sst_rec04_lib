# sst_rec04_lib

sstRec04Lib - Library for working with records

This lib based on idea "STASH" from bruce eckels book "thinking in c++".

I take this idea as base for small record management system.

This library should be build with QT 5.5 and qt creator 3.5.1.

Structure of coding projects should be:

.. [libs] <BR>
   [sstStr01Lib] <BR>
   [sstMisc01Lib] <BR>
   [sstRec04Lib] <BR>
   [Doxygen_Output] <BR>
